# mForest starting sketch

This repository is designed to help my friends enhance their programming skills through a creative coding project. It serves as a starting point for creating a P5.js sketch that visualizes a digital forest.

While the initial code doesn't represent a forest, it demonstrates how to draw basic shapes and implement interaction in P5.js. Additionally, the marcusAbstraction file introduces the use of classes and objectsâ€”an important concept that will be valuable for advanced studies many of us aim to pursue.

## Instructions to my friends
- Open the index.html file in your web browser
- Open `sketch.js` within your favourite text editor and try to comprehend how the code influences what you see in the browser.
- Once you're ready to begin, Remove the code within the `sketch.js` file for a blank sketch
- Refer back to the accompanying  `.pdf` for guidence & instruction
- `marcusAbstraction.js` contains some slightly more advanced code that controls the on screen comments seen when the button is clicked. Trying to understand the concept of how classes and objects are used will be extremely beneficial for PFMS.
