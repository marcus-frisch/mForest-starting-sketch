# mForest starting sketch

This repository is designed to help my friends enhance their programming skills through a creative coding project. It serves as a starting point for creating a P5.js sketch that visualizes a digital forest.

While the example code doesn't represent a forest, it demonstrates how to draw basic shapes and implement interaction in P5.js. Additionally, the `marcusAbstraction` file introduces the use of classes and objects â€” an important programming concept that you will need to understand for future project and career.

## Instructions to my friends
- Open the `P5_example/example.html` file in your web browser
- Open `P5_example/example.js` within your favourite text editor and try to comprehend how the code influences what you see in the browser.
- Within the enclosing folder, the `index.html` file will be the file that should display your forest within your web browser. The `forest.js` file should contain the code to render your forest.
- Refer back to the accompanying  `.pdf` shared on discord for guidence & instruction
- `P5_example/marcusAbstraction.js` contains some slightly more advanced code that controls the on screen comments seen when the button is clicked. Trying to understand the concept of how classes and objects are used will be extremely beneficial for PFMS.
